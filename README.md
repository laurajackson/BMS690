The Capstone Project provides an opportunity for students to engage in high-level inquiry focusing on an area of specialization within the profession.  Capstone projects will be inquiry and practice-centered and will draw upon areas of interest to the student and focus from the program such as philosophy, sociology, policy, research, principles of pedagogy, curriculum design, or technology, among others. All capstones aim to bridge theory and practice and are aimed to have an impact on the professional life of students.
